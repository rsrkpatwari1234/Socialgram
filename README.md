## Deployement

### Frontend deployment

https://socialgram.netlify.app/

## Backend Code

https://github.com/shelcia/fb-clone-backend

### To work with this repo

- Clone this repo

- Create a new file with name <code>.env</code> in the same directory as the <code>src</code> folder to set up the environment variable for the backend

- Inside <code>.env</code> file, type <code>REACT_APP_HEROKU_LINK = https://fb-clone-backend.herokuapp.com/</code> . This step sets up the backend for the front end which is deployed at heroku. Without this, storing/loading of data would not work. For further details about the url, follow the [backend repository](https://github.com/shelcia/fb-clone-backend)
